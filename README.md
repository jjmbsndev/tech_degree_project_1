 ## Description

 A number guessing game developed per the criteria for the Unit 1 Python Project in the Treehouse Tech Degree Program.  
 A user should be able to enter a number by assigning a number 1 - 10.  Output is generated indicating whether the guess was higher, lower, or correct.  Errors are caught for incorrect input asking the user to try again.  When the user guesses correctly, then the number of tries is printed and assigned a score that is evaluated against a high score.  The user is displayed the score and whether is matched the high score.  The user is then prompted as to whether they would like to play again and the high score is retained for the next round.

 ### Challenges 
 
 Keeping parts in the game separate functions was initially difficult, but distilling them down to their main task in pseudo code helped.
